# Directory 

Within different folder is presented my knowledge and experience of Machine Learning

### Code/

This repository show the raw code I used to create my algorithms. I am quite skilled in Python using PEP 8 and Object Oriented Programming. 
Some of the algorithms I used were:

- Logistic Regression
- Regression Testing Using SVM
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

### datasets/

These are my datasets that I used in my code and notebooks. Most are in Excel CSV format and some are in MySQL database. 
Datasets are available upon request by creating an issue to replicate code or notebook.

### notebooks/

These are some of presentations where I used markup and raw Python code to present data analysis and machine learning upon different equities.
Some of the sectors I am currently analyzing are Financials and Technology within the NASDAQ Exchange.

### reports/

After analysis, I will create PDF formats of notebooks for presentable reports. If code is broken, please make an issue above. 
Feel free to fix error or I will upload a shell script using BASH or PowerShell to install mandatory dependencies.
