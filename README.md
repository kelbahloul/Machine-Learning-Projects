# Machine-Learning-Projects
They are compiled with my Mini-Projects for stock prediction based on various Machine Learning techniques.
# Project-1-Logistic-Regression-Based-On-TSLA-Tesla
this project was coded in python with documentation using Jupyter Notebook. It shows whether it is better to Buy (1) a share(s) or sell (-1). This is based on historical data of 10 years derived from Yahoo Finance.
